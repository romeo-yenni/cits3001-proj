new project spec has cleared up a lot on the how the opinions/uncertainties work
unless it was just changed from what it was initially

instead of opinion being a range of floats from -1.0 to 1.0 (eg. 0.56, -0.98, 0.11)
what i thought...

it seems as though opinion is just either 1 or zero....
1 meaning node wants to vote and 0 meaning node doesnt want to vote.

and then a greater uncertainty means a node is more like to change its opinion

the project lookin a lot simpler now i guess.

will need to change the code up a bit but it wont be very hard.
